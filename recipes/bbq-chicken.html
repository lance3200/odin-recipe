<h2>Description</h2>
<p> BBQ is such a delightful meal to cook, really great for gatherings with families, friends, and co-workers.
  With the flavors of BBQ & Chicken what can go wrong? (besides hitting the nae nae)</p>
  <p> For all my fellow BBQ lovers this will make your uvula gargle</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups cider vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons poultry seasoning</li>
    <li>2 pounds cut up chicken pieces</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat grill to medium heat.</li>
      <li>In a small skillet combine the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and put over low heat. Add the poultry seasoning while stirring constantly; when sauce mixes well and starts to bubble, it is done.</li>
      <li>Place chicken on hot grill and brush with sauce. Grill for 45 to 60 minutes, turning every 5 to 10 minutes, and brush chicken with sauce after each turning. Grill until chicken is done and juices run clear. (Note: Be sure to keep an eye on the chicken as it cooks, as it tends to have flair ups due to the oil and chicken drippings!)</li>
      </ol>
